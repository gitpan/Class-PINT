Class-PINT version 0.01
=======================

Class::PINT is an implementation of selected Tangram, and other OOPF
related features on top of Class::DBI.

** WARNING - this release is a proof of concept, use at your own risk **

The goal of PINT is to provide some of the power and flexibility of
Tangram with the maturity, transparency and extensibility of CDBI.
I also hope we can provide a place where more useful and adventurous
patchs, subclasses and plugins can be organised and integrated into
a usable package.
